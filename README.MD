# Movie Rental Repository

This repository is a movie rental dummy platform where users can browse and rent movies. Please be aware that this is a demonstration app, designed to display the proper architecture and file/folder structure of a React application using idiomatic best practices.

React idiomatic refers to a set of best practices and conventions for writing clean and maintainable code when developing applications using the React JavaScript library. It involves following a consistent code style, using appropriate React patterns, and writing modular and reusable components. The goal of idiomatic React is to make it easier to understand and maintain the codebase, and to ensure a high-quality and scalable application:

- Using functional components and hooks whenever possible, instead of class components.
- Keeping components small, focused, and modular.
- Using prop types for type checking and better documentation.
- Managing state and side effects using the useState and useEffect hooks.
- Writing tests for components using a testing library such as Jest.
- Avoiding direct manipulation of the DOM, and instead relying on React's Virtual DOM.
- Keeping components stateless, and lifting state up to a common ancestor.
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders by using memoization or shouldComponentUpdate.
- Keeping the component tree shallow and reducing props drilling.
- Using proper naming conventions, such as PascalCase for component names and camelCase for props.
- These are just a few examples, and following best practices can help make your React code more readable, maintainable, and scalable.

This app is intended to showcase my ability to interpret a brief, solve problems, and construct a structured application. **I am confident in my ability to deliver even greater results in real-world scenarios.**
